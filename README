Pytrialer module came to be when I wanted to download movies from
apple.com/trailers on my Linux desktop. As a user you probably want
graphical interface (look up "pyqtrailer").

Pytrailer is very simple python module using JSON and few simple
regular expressions to simplify access to trailer information on
www.apple.com/trailers. It needs some more love currently (especially
domcumenting interface a bit), but is functional otherwise.
