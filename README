Pytrialer module came to be when I wanted to download movies from
apple.com/trailers on my Linux desktop. As a user you probably want
graphical interface (http://github.com/sochotnicky/pyqtrailer).

Pytrailer is very simple python module using JSON and few simple
regular expressions to simplify access to trailer information on
www.apple.com/trailers.
